    <li>
The grease replacement is complete when new grease appears in the outlet port. The new grease can be distinguished from the old one by color.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Clean the outlet with cloth and release over-injected grease.<p>
①	Place a vinyl bag on the grease outlet.<br>
②	Commission the Axis-S at ±45° for 1.5 hours at 50% speed.<br>
③	Work so that the injected amount and the discharged amount are the same. If the discharged amount is less, the residual amount needs to be discharged through the inlet.<br>
④	Remove the vinyl bag.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Clean the greased around the outlet and assemble the seal-taped plug into its original state.

</li>

■ Procedure in discharging excessively fueled grease and residual pressure after grease replacement and injection
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
<li>(1)	Attach a grease receiver or a hose to the grease outlet to prevent contamination from discharged grease.
