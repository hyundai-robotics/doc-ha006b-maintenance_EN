■	Grease Replacement

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Make the H-Axis arm vertically and the V axis horizontally.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the grease outlet plug.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Inject the grease into the grease inlet using a grease gun.

    <li>
The grease replacement is complete when new grease appears in the outlet port. The new grease can be distinguished from the old one by color.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Move the H-Axis for a few minutes to eject the old grease and then add grease until the new grease appears in the outlet port.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Clean the outlet with cloth and release over-injected grease.<p>
①	Place a vinyl bag on the grease outlet.<br>
②	Commission the Axis-H, V at ±45° for 1.5 hours at 50% speed.<br>
③	Work so that the injected amount and the discharged amount are the same. If the discharged amount is less, the residual amount needs to be discharged through the inlet.<br>
④	Remove the vinyl bag.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Clean the greased around the outlet and assemble the seal-taped plug into its original state.
</li>
</ol>

■   Procedure in discharging excessively fueled grease and residual pressure after grease replacement and injection
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>Attach a grease receiver or a hose to the grease outlet to prevent contamination from discharged grease.
   </li><br>
    <li>
Operate it within a range without surrounding and interference under the following conditions.<p>
①	Operation angle: H-Axis, 80° or more / V-Axis, 70° or more.<br>
②	Operation speed: 50%<br>
③	Operation time: 20 minutes or more<br>
   </li><br>
    <li>
Wipe the outlet port with a cloth and attach the plug.
