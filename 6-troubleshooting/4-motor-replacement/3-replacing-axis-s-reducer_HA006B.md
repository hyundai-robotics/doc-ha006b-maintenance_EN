# 6.4.3. Replacing Axis-S Reducer [HA006B]

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Set the controller to teaching mode and set the robot to standby [ON] condition. If the robot is not in standby [ON] condition, check whether the arm is sufficiently fixated to avoid it from dropping. And then proceed to (4).
    </li><br>
    <li>
The posture of the robot shall be as shown in [Figure 6.13] to prevent the arm from dropping.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Turn the main power [OFF] with the controller power [OFF].
    </li><br>
    <li>
Upon disconnecting the motor wire, remove the motor bolts to detach the motor from the robot body.
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to [Figure 6.14], remove the bolt that fixes the adapter to the lower frame.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the part above the adapter slowly using a crane.
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to [Figure 6.14], remove the bolt on the outlet side of the reducer to detach the adapter. 
(The oil seal is assembled to the adapter.)
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the ring (AS568-156) and the bolt on the inlet side of the reducer to detach the reducer.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Replace the O-ring (AS569-159) for the new reducer before assembling the reducer. Clean and deoil the bolt of the reducer and tighten it using a torque wrench to the specified torque (torque, 15.6 Nm). Bolts need to be tightened in a diagonal sequence.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Replace the O-ring (AS568-156) for the adapter before assembling the adapter. Clean and deoil the bolt on the adapter and tighten using a torque wrench to the specified torque (torque, 73.5 Nm).
Bolts need to be tightened in a diagonal sequence.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Assemble the part above the adapter with the adapter slowly using a crane, which had been removed in Step (6).
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to [6.4.2], assemble the motor and connect the motor wire.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Fill up with the specified grease.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Confirm that there is no error in robot's motion.
</li>
