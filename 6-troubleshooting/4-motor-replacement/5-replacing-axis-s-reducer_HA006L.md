# 6.4.5. Replacing Axis-S Reducer [HA006L]


<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Set the controller to teaching mode and set the robot to standby [ON] condition. If the robot is not in standby [ON] condition, check whether the arm is sufficiently fixated to avoid it from dropping. And then proceed to (4).
    </li><br>
    <li>
The posture of the robot shall be as shown in [Figure 6.19] to prevent the arm from dropping.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Turn the main power [OFF] with the controller power [OFF].
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the motor wire and remove the bolt from the motor to remove the motor from the robot body.
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to [Figure 6.20], remove the bolt from the outlet side of the reducer.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the part above the outlet side of the reducer slowly using a crane.
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to [Figure 6.20], remove the ball bearing 6816ZZ, center gear, ball bearing 6816ZZ, and O-ring AS(ARP)568-173.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the bolt from the inlet side of the reducer to remove the reducer.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the bolt from the cable hollow to remove the cable hollow.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Replace the O-ring (G70) and assemble the cable hollow.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Replace the O-ring AS(ARP)568-165 and AS(ARP)568-173 for the new reducer and assemble the reducer. Clean and deoil the bolt of the reducer and tighten it using a torque wrench to the specified torque (torque, 200.7 Nm). 
Bolts need to be tightened in a diagonal sequence.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Assemble the reducer with the ball bearing 6816 ZZ, center gear, and ball bearing 6816ZZ. (If the bearing is damaged, replace with a new one.)
    </li><br>
    <li>
Assemble the part above the outlet side with the reducer slowly using a crane, which had been removed in Step (6). Clean and deoil the bolt of the reducer and tighten using a torque wrench to the specified torque (torque, 72 Nm). 
Bolts need to be tightened in a diagonal sequence.
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to [6.4.2], assemble the motor and connect the motor wire.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Fill up with the specified grease.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Confirm that there is no error in robot's motion.
</li>
