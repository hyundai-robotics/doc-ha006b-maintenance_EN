# 6.4.4. Replacing Axis-H, V Reducer [HA006B]

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Set the controller to teaching mode and set the robot to standby [ON] condition. If the robot is not in standby [ON] condition, check whether the arm is sufficiently fixated to avoid it from dropping. And then proceed to (4).
    </li><br>
    <li>
The posture of the robot shall be as shown as below to prevent the arm from dropping.
For Axis-H: refer to [Figure 6.15]
For Axis-V: refer to [Figure 6.17]
    </li><br>
    <li>
Turn the main power [OFF] with the controller power [OFF].
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the motor wire and remove the bolt from the motor to remove the motor from the robot body.
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to the following figure, remove the bolt from the outlet side of the reducer.<br>
For Axis-H: refer to [Figure 6.16]<br>
For Axis-V: refer to [Figure 6.18]<br>
    </li><br>
    <li>
Remove the part above the outlet side of the reducer slowly using a crane.
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to the figure in (5), remove the O-ring (AS568-156 / S90).
    </li><br>
    <li>
Upon removal of the bolt from the inlet side of the reducer, remove the reducer.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Replace the O-ring (AS569-159 / S110) for the new reducer before assembling the reducer. Clean and deoil the bolt of the reducer and tighten it using a torque wrench to the specified torque. (Torque 15.6Nm / 8.8 Nm). 
Bolts need to be tightened in a diagonal sequence.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Replace the O-ring (AS568-156 / S90).
    </li><br>
    <li>
Assemble the part above the adapter with the reducer slowly using a crane, which had been removed in Step (6). Clean and deoil the bolt of the reducer and tighten it using a torque wrench to the specified torque (Torque M10 : 72.5 Nm / M6 : 15.7 Nm). 
Bolts need to be tightened in a diagonal sequence.
    </li><br>
    <li>
With reference to [6.4.2], assemble the motor and connect the motor wire.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Fill up with the specified grease.
    </li><br>
    <li>
Confirm that there is no error in robot's motion.
</li>
</ol>
