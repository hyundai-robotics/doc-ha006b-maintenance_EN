# 4.5. Checking the timing belt

Small robot HA series has parts where the timing belt is applied on the operating assembly of the wrist axis. 
For the operating assembly of the timing belt, check the tension of the belt after every 1,500 hours and when there is vibration/noise on the belt. If the tension of the timing belt is not appropriate, it may have a severely negative effect on the performance of the robot.

*	Check the timing belt of B axis

    ①	Turn off the power.<br>
    ②	Take off the arm pipe cover.<br>
    ③	Press the center of the timing belt with the given force (F=0.2kgf).<br>
    ④	Check the pressed length.<br>
    ⑤	If the pressed length is not appropriate (3.4mm), loosen the motor flange bolt slightly.<br>
    ⑥	Set the tension of the timing belt.<br>
    ⑦	Tighten the motor flange bolt. (75kgf·cm)<br>
    ⑧	Assemble the arm pipe cover.<br>
    ⑨	Turn on the power.
